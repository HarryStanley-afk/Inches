# Inches

Inches is a humble program that converts lengths from inches to feet. 

The program will ask the user to input a length in inches. It will then convert the length given into feet.

This project is useful because it can clear up certain issues regarding the uses of the imperial and metric systems. For those that use the metric system, inches are relatively easier to understand than feet, and if they need or want imperial units for anything, they could use this program to convert the desired length in inches to feet.
